# Airbnb_Analysis


## Introduction
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people looking for accommodations in specific locales. 
The company has come a long way since 2007, when its co-founders first came up with the idea to invite paying guests to sleep on an air mattress in their living room. 
According to Airbnb's latest data, it now has more than 7 million listings, covering some 100,000 cities and towns in 220-plus countries and regions worldwide.


## Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.



## Approach

### MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval
Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset. 
Perform queries and data retrieval operations to extract the necessary information for your analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation: 
Clean the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary. 
Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

### Price Analysis and Visualization: 
Develop a streamlit web application that utilizes the cleaned data to analyze and visualize how prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons. 
Create dynamic plots and charts that enable users to explore price trends.

### Ratings & Availability Analysis by Season: 
Analyze the ratings and availability of Airbnb listings based on seasonal variations, country, and area. 

### Interactive Visualizations: 
Develop dynamic and interactive visualizations that allow users to filter and drill down into the data based on their preferences. 
Enable users to interact with the visualizations to explore specific regions, property types, or ratings.

### Dashboard Creation: 
Utilize Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from your analysis. 
Combine different visualizations, such as maps, charts, and tables, to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.
